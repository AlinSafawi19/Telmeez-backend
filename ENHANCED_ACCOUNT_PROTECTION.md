# Enhanced Account Protection for Multiple Wrong Sign-In Attempts üîí

## Overview

The authentication system now includes comprehensive protection against brute force attacks and multiple failed login attempts with multiple layers of security.

## Current Protection Features ‚úÖ

### 1. **Account-Based Lockout**
- **Trigger**: 5 failed login attempts
- **Duration**: 15 minutes (configurable)
- **Reset**: Automatic after duration or successful login
- **Status Code**: HTTP 423 (Locked)

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
- **Auth Endpoints**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **General API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Brute Force Protection**: 10 attempts per 5 minutes

### 3. **Progressive Lockout** (New Feature)
- **Enabled**: Via `PROGRESSIVE_LOCKOUT=true` environment variable
- **Behavior**: Lockout duration doubles with each lockout
- **Example**:
  - 1st lockout: 15 minutes
  - 2nd lockout: 30 minutes
  - 3rd lockout: 60 minutes
  - 4th lockout: 120 minutes
  - Maximum: 24 hours
- **Reset**: After successful login

### 4. **IP-Based Protection** (New Feature)
- **Enabled**: Via `IP_TRACKING=true` environment variable
- **Trigger**: 10 failed attempts from same IP
- **Duration**: 1 hour IP lockout
- **Scope**: Affects all accounts from that IP
- **Reset**: Automatic after duration

### 5. **Suspicious Activity Detection** (New Feature)
- **Enabled**: Via `SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY_DETECTION=true` environment variable
- **Trigger**: 3+ failed attempts
- **Action**: Logs suspicious activity with details
- **Future**: Can trigger email alerts to security team

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Basic Account Protection
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=5                    # Failed attempts before lockout
LOCKOUT_DURATION=900000                 # 15 minutes in milliseconds

# Progressive Lockout
PROGRESSIVE_LOCKOUT=true                # Enable progressive lockout
LOCKOUT_MULTIPLIER=2                    # Multiply lockout time by this factor
MAX_LOCKOUT_DURATION=86400000           # 24 hours max lockout

# IP-Based Protection
IP_TRACKING=true                        # Enable IP-based tracking
MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_IP=10                  # Max attempts per IP address

```

## User Experience

### Frontend Error Handling

The frontend already handles these error codes:

```typescript
// In SignIn.tsx and ForgotPassword.tsx
switch (errors.errorCode) {
  case 'ACCOUNT_LOCKED':
    errorMsg = t.signin_errors.account_locked;
    break;
  case 'IP_LOCKED':
    errorMsg = 'Too many failed attempts from this IP address. Please try again later.';
    break;
  // ... other cases
}
```

### Error Messages

1. **Account Locked**:
   ```
   "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed attempts. 
   Please try again in X minutes."
   ```

2. **IP Locked**:
   ```
   "Too many failed attempts from this IP. 
   Please try again in X minutes."
   ```

3. **Progressive Lockout**:
   ```
   "Account locked due to repeated failed attempts. 
   Lockout duration has been increased for security."
   ```

## Security Benefits

### üõ°Ô∏è **Multi-Layer Protection**
- **Account-level**: Protects individual accounts
- **IP-level**: Protects against distributed attacks
- **Rate limiting**: Protects against automated attacks

### üìà **Progressive Deterrence**
- Each lockout increases duration
- Discourages repeated attempts
- Prevents rapid-fire attacks

### üîç **Activity Monitoring**
- Tracks IP addresses used
- Monitors attempt patterns
- Logs suspicious behavior

### üö® **Early Warning System**
- Detects suspicious activity early
- Can trigger security alerts
- Provides audit trail

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface FailedAttemptInfo {
  count: number;           // Current failed attempts
  lastAttempt: number;     // Timestamp of last attempt
  lockoutCount: number;    // How many times account has been locked
  ipAddresses: Set<string>; // IPs used for attempts
  firstAttempt: number;    // When first attempt was made
}
```

### Memory Management

- **In-Memory Storage**: Fast access for real-time protection
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Old entries automatically removed
- **Production Consideration**: For high-traffic sites, consider Redis/database storage

### Security Considerations

1. **No Information Disclosure**: Error messages don't reveal if email exists
2. **IP Spoofing Protection**: Uses multiple IP detection methods
3. **Timing Attacks**: Consistent response times regardless of user existence
4. **Audit Trail**: All attempts logged for security analysis

## Production Recommendations

### 1. **Database Storage**
For high-traffic applications, consider storing failed attempts in database:

```typescript
// Example schema
interface FailedAttemptRecord {
  email: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  attemptCount: number;
  lockoutCount: number;
  firstAttempt: Date;
  lastAttempt: Date;
  isLocked: boolean;
  lockoutExpires: Date;
}
```

### 2. **Redis Implementation**
For better performance and persistence:

```typescript
// Using Redis for distributed systems
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

async function recordFailedAttempt(email: string, ipAddress: string) {
  const key = `failed_attempts:${email}`;
  const ipKey = `ip_attempts:${ipAddress}`;
  
  await client.multi()
    .incr(key)
    .expire(key, 3600) // 1 hour TTL
    .incr(ipKey)
    .expire(ipKey, 3600)
    .exec();
}
```

### 3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
Set up monitoring for:

- High lockout rates
- Suspicious IP patterns
- Geographic anomalies
- Time-based attack patterns

### 4. **Admin Dashboard**
Consider building an admin interface to:

- View locked accounts
- Manually unlock accounts
- Monitor security metrics
- Configure protection settings

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Lockout**: 5 failed attempts ‚Üí 15-minute lockout
2. **Progressive Lockout**: Multiple lockouts increase duration
3. **IP Lockout**: 10 attempts from same IP ‚Üí 1-hour lockout
4. **Cross-IP Protection**: IP lockout affects all accounts
5. **Successful Reset**: Login clears all counters
6. **Timeout Reset**: Lockouts expire automatically

### Test Commands

```bash
# Test basic lockout
for i in {1..6}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrong"}'
done

# Test progressive lockout
# Run multiple lockout cycles and verify increasing durations

# Test IP lockout
# Use different emails but same IP for 10+ attempts
```

## Summary

The enhanced account protection system provides comprehensive security against multiple wrong sign-in attempts through:

- **Multi-layer protection** (account + IP + rate limiting)
- **Progressive deterrence** (increasing lockout durations)
- **Activity monitoring** (suspicious behavior detection)
- **Production-ready** configuration and monitoring

This system significantly reduces the risk of brute force attacks while maintaining a good user experience for legitimate users.
